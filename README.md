# Critical Analysis of Deconfounded Pretraining to Improve Visio-Linguistic Models
This repo contains the code that accompanies the paper "[Critical Analysis of Deconfounded Pretraining to Improve Visio-Linguistic Models](https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frai.2022.736791/full)".
Currently, the code in it hasn't been cleaned up yet.
If I notice a lot of people want to build on it / reproduce it, I will update it with more detailed instructions of how to reproduce the results in the paper, along with cleaned-up code.
